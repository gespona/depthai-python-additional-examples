# depthai-python-additional-examples
My own python additional examples using DepthAI

# Usage

Strongly recommend to use PyCharm as suggested on the basic tutorials from DepthAI

So it creates venv for you and not messing with system installation when install requirments

# Installation

Each folder contains one example with own requirements and models

# Examples

## gen2-face-detector

Face detector from modelplace.ai

```
cd gen2-face-detector
pip install -r requirements
python3 main.py 
```
